swerv.config            | Configuration script for SweRV  


This script will generate a consistent st of `defines/#defines needed for the design and testbench.  
A perl hash (*perl_configs.pl*) and a JSON format for SweRV-iss are also generated.  

While the defines fines may be modified by hand, it is recommended that this script be used to generate a consistent set.
